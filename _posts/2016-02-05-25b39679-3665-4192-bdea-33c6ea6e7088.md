I spent the summer of 2015 as an intern at iZettle (Europe's competitor to [Square][0]). My job was to analyze data, the description in the job ad was

- Collect and analyze customer acquisition data in order to improve the way we acquire customers in digital channels across ten markets. 

- Work with data in order to identify issues in our acquisition flows, and bring forward suggestions for business development.
